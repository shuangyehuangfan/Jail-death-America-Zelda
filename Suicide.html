    <p>Bostock`s article highlights the lack of public scrutiny and attention given to self-inflicted deaths in prisons, despite their significant impact. It mentions the case of a notorious serial killer, Shipman, whose suicide received substantial media coverage, focusing on the details of how he committed the act. The announcement of a police investigation, an inquest, and an inquiry by the Prison Ombudsman generated considerable interest. However, Bostock argues that such individual investigations have limitations in addressing broader issues of institutional neglect and systemic failings within the prison system, which are often the underlying factors contributing to high rates of suicides. The role of the Prison Ombudsman inquiring into suicides is seen as a positive step by penal reform groups. Bostock emphasizes the need for public debate and potentially a public inquiry to address the alarming rates of suicides and self-harm in prisons, examining their causes and potential prevention measures. It mentions statistics on suicides in prisons, including the disproportionate involvement of women and the projected increase in the prison population. Bostock also highlights flaws in the investigation of deaths in custody, including suicides, and calls for radical reform to enhance the welfare of vulnerable individuals in prison and reduce suicides. </p>

    <p>Samaritans` report discusses various factors related to suicide risk in prisons and highlights the work of Samaritans in addressing these issues. It mentions that many individuals in prison have experienced difficult life events prior to imprisonment, which can contribute to their vulnerability. The adjustment to the prison environment and uncertainty about the prison sentence also affect suicide risk. Male local establishments, which receive prisoners directly from courts and house them during the early days in prison, have the highest suicide rates in prisons in England and Wales. </p>
    <p>The nature of the prison regime and conditions significantly impact suicide risk. Samaritans` Listener scheme, in partnership with HMPPS, trains peer-support volunteers known as Listeners within prisons. Samaritans receives a higher number of contacts from female prisons compared to the prison population ratio. Mental health concerns are frequently discussed in contacts with prisoners, particularly in female prisons.  </p>
    <p>The breakdown of Samaritans` contacts by prison type reveals that specific prison roles and security levels influence the topics discussed. Open prisons have fewer concerns about mental health compared to closed conditions. Self-harm is more frequently discussed by women than men within prisons. Family concerns and social support problems are common topics among prisoners contacting Samaritans. These individuals are more likely to discuss homelessness and face benefits, legal, and financial issues.  </p>
    <p>Samaritans` report emphasizes that concerns related to prison life are frequently discussed in Samaritans` face-to-face contacts. It underscores the importance of anonymous support for prisoners and highlights their need for social support, especially in youth offender institutions and female prisons. Overall, Samaritans` report provides insights into the factors contributing to suicide risk in prisons and Samaritans` efforts to address these challenges.  </p>
