        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A comprehensive analysis of deaths in American jails was conducted, focusing on demographic factors, causes of death, and pre-existing medical conditions. The analysis included deaths per state, deaths per year, deaths per cause (short and detailed), deaths per age group, deaths per race, and deaths per gender.   </p>
        <p>The dataset revealed important insights into the causes of death, particularly suicides, homicides, and deaths related to addictions such as drugs and alcohol. Attention was given to preventing these causes of death in prisons.   </p>
        <p>The analysis covered a period from 2008 to 2019 and included data from 523 jails. The data on suicides in US jails highlighted the need for preventive measures, considering factors such as age, gender, and race.   </p>
        <p>The lack of public scrutiny and attention given to self-inflicted deaths in prisons underscores the need for understanding and addressing this issue. Additional literature sources provide insights into preventing suicide in prisons. Additionally, there was a specific focus on deaths caused by drug and alcohol overdoses, as indicated by the analysis of the cause of death data.   </p>
        <p>To enhance the Digital Humanities project, interactive features like maps, timelines, and charts are incorporated to allow users to explore the data and understand patterns.   </p>
        <p>Overall, the research aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of deaths in American jails, identify trends, and inform strategies to prevent suicides, homicides, and deaths related to substance abuse.  </p>
