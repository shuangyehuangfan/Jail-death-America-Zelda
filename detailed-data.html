        <h2>Analysis literature: Main Source of Data</h2>
        <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-jails/">Reuters Investigates. (2020, October 16). Dying Inside: The Hidden Crisis in America`s Jails. </a>
        <p><strong>Historical context:</strong>Reason of collecting data by Reuters was that U.S government did not release jail mortality data, although public information available from jails presented increasingly high rates of death. In U.S the Justice Departments is responsible institution for collecting data related to the jail deaths, but however it is not obliged to release full information. To understand the situation, Reuters made investigation and obtained jail death related data and released them to the public. Obtained data provide information what are the main death causes. Some of these causes show significant increase by number of deaths. Drug and alcohol related lethal outcomes has been increasing the most.  </p>
        <p>Drug and alcohol-related jail deaths spiked between 2000 and 2018, increasing by roughly 381% -- the largest increase of any cause by a margin, according to the BJS report. While the exact rates of inmates with substance use disorders (SUDs) is difficult to measure, some research shows that now an estimated 65% percent of the United States prison population has an active SUD. Another 20% percent did not meet the official criteria for an SUD, but were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their crime. Substance abuse is classified as a mental illness, by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency, but has long been treated as a criminal offense by the justice system, rather than a public health issue. Decades of science shows that providing comprehensive substance use treatment to criminal offenders while incarcerated works, reducing both drug use and crime after an inmate returns to the community. Treatment while in jail or prison is critical to reducing overall crime and other drug-related societal burdens—such as lost job productivity, family disintegration and a continual return to jail or prison, known as recidivism. Inadequate treatment while incarcerated also contributes to overdoses and deaths when inmates leave the prison system. </p>
        <p> The recent National Academy of Sciences report on Medications for Opioid Use Disorder stated that only 5% of people with opioid use disorder in jail and prison settings receive medication treatment. A survey of prison medical directors suggested that most are not aware of the benefits of using medications with treatment, and when treatment is offered, it usually consists of only behavioral counseling, and/or detoxification without follow-up treatment. Despite the cost, treatment in the criminal justice system saves money in the long run because there is a possibility that former prisoners get back to healthy life and become respectable members of society. </p>
